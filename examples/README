           Gluster Deploy - Tool to install and configure GlusterFS

Introduction
============

Gluster Deploy (gdeploy), deploys configurations. A configuration can be:

* Backend setup configuration.
* Gluster cluster setup (Volume configuration).
* Client (mount) configuration.
* Feature configurations like:
  # NFS-Ganesha configuration
  # Samba configuration
  # Snapshot configuration.
  # Geo-replication configuration.
  # Quota configuration

In addition to above configurations any volume set operation can be done from
the remote host. The CLI will be explained later.

The configurations can be put together or can be run individually. For example
creating backend, setting up a GlusterFS volume, and configuring NFS-Ganesha can
be one configuration or can be split up into three individual configurations.


Configuration files
===================

The configuration file is made up of sections. Currently supported sections
include:

* [hosts]
* [devices]
* [disktype]
* [diskcount]
* [stripesize]
* [vgs]
* [pools]
* [lvs]
* [mountpoints]
* {host-specific-data-for-above}
* [clients]
* [volume]
* [snapshot]

TODO: Explain all of the above

Of the above mentioned configurations, the tool itself does not mandate most of
the values.

# Brick configuration:
